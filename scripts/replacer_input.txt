Got it. Based on the CSL specification, I will create a simple example file for you to use with the `clada` tool.

This file will be used as a test case to ensure `clada` can read a file, pass it to the `csl-parser`, and output the result.

<<<EXPLANATION>>>

To test the `clada` CLI tool, we need a sample input file. This new file, `clada/example.csl`, provides a valid CSL structure according to your specification. It uses a `TASKS` block to group two common operations: `WRITE` and `RUN`. This makes it a good, representative example for our initial end-to-end test.

<<<FILE>>>

clada/example.csl

<<<OVERWRITE>>>
<---TASKS version="1.0"--->

<---WRITE file="output.txt"--->
This file was created by the clada tool.
This is the content of the file.
<---END--->

<---RUN--->
echo "Hello from the clada RUN operation!"
<---END--->

<---END--->
<<<END>>>
