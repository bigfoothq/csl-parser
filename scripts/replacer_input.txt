Two changes needed:

<<<EXPLANATION>>>
Add TASKS entry behavior to state transition rules
<<<FILE>>>
csl-parser/main/core/doc/csl_imp.md
<<<SEARCH>>>
When END marker encountered:
- If `insideTasks` true and state is not TASKS: set state to TASKS
- Otherwise: set state to null and insideTasks to false

Invalid transitions throw immediately with line number.
<<<REPLACE>>>
When TASKS marker encountered:
- If `insideTasks` true: throw error (nested TASKS)
- Otherwise: set state to TASKS, set insideTasks to true

When END marker encountered:
- If `insideTasks` true and state is not TASKS: set state to TASKS
- Otherwise: set state to null and insideTasks to false

Invalid transitions throw immediately with line number.
<<<END>>>

<<<EXPLANATION>>>
Add standard error message examples
<<<FILE>>>
