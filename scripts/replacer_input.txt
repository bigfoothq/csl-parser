This `ENOENT` error is a classic `npm` issue when using Git dependencies.

### Analysis of the Error

1.  **What `npm` is doing:** When you run `npm install`, it sees the `git+https...` dependency for `csl-parser`. It successfully clones the repository into a temporary cache directory (`.../git-cloneQSFBhv`).
2.  **What `npm` expects:** After cloning, `npm`'s next step is to read the `package.json` file from the *root* of that cloned repository. This file is the package manifest; it tells `npm` the package's name, version, and—most importantly—its main entry point.
3.  **Why it fails:** The error message `Could not read package.json: Error: ENOENT` means the file does not exist. Your `csl-parser` repository is missing a `package.json` file in its root directory. Without it, `npm` cannot treat the repository as a valid package.

### Solution

The solution is to add a `package.json` file to the root of the `csl-parser` project and commit it. This file will define the necessary metadata for `npm`.

***

<<<EXPLANATION>>>

To fix the `npm install` error, you must add a `package.json` file to the root of the `csl-parser` repository. This file defines the project as a valid `npm` package, specifying its name, version, type, and main entry point. The `main` field points to the public API file (`index.js`), which exports the `parse` function.

{
  "name": "csl-parser",
  "version": "1.0.0",

### Next Steps

1.  Add the `package.json` file with the content above to the root of your `csl-parser` Git repository.
2.  Commit and push this change to the branch you are tracking in `clada`.
3.  Update the commit hash in `clada/package.json` to this new commit.
4.  Run `npm install` again in the `clada` directory. It should now succeed.
