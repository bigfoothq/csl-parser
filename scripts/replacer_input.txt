Of course. Moving configuration files can often lead to path-related issues. The error you're seeing with `node:test` and `node:assert` indicates that TypeScript is having trouble locating the type definitions for Node.js's built-in modules. This is a common hiccup when the project root changes, as it can confuse the TypeScript language server.

Here is a change to make your TypeScript configuration more explicit, which should resolve the issue.

<<<EXPLANATION>>>

By moving `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`, you've effectively changed your project's root directory. The TypeScript error `Cannot find module 'node:test'` suggests that the type definitions for Node.js are not being resolved correctly in this new structure.

To fix this, we'll explicitly tell the TypeScript compiler to include the Node.js types by adding the `types` option to your `tsconfig.json`. This makes the configuration more robust and helps ensure the tooling can correctly locate all necessary type definitions, regardless of any potential confusion about the project root.
